                <p>
                    When user posts an ad for the first time, during the ad submission, a user account is created for user. There is no explicit link to sign up as a new user. Here user account is only created when user is just about to submit a new ad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the “Post Free Ad” page, in Sign up panel (last panel in page), user will fill up his email address, and then system will ask for a password. Once user fills up the password, then upon “Submit Free Ad.” button click, system will automatically sign in and complete submission of the ad/post. Above is the case, when user email is already registered in system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During new post submission, in Sign up panel when user type his email address, system will check if any user account is available in database, if email address has no associated user account; system will ask to type in “Password”  &  “Re-Password”. Then upon “Submit Free Ad.” button click, system will automatically create a user account and complete post submission.
